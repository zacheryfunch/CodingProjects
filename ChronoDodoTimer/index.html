<!--/*   Let's make a Timer Webapp. Goal:
        Goal: I want to make a timer for ChronoDodo. a Book on helping get your kids
         to sleep independently.
         So my current need is to have a timer that runs for: 
          Round 1 : 1 min, display 10sec visit ,
                    2minutes, display 10sec visit,
                    3 minutes. 
                     2min calin
            Round 2 : 3min, 3min, 3min, 2min hug
            Round 3 : 4min, 4min, 4min, 2min hug
            Round 4+ : 4min, 4min, 4min, 2min hug.
        - I would like the whole webapp to be small enough to fit on a phone screen.
        - I would like a small space to explain the next action.
        - I would like a drop down menu to select what round we're on.
         for a first version i will only use the round for my kids
         but eventually i want to include all of rounds.
        - Day and age settings with prerecorded Rounds order, guiding the user.

<!--/*      +Plan:
        v0.0 Code JS to change the HTML to count seconds.
        v0.1 
        v0.2 Make a Timer that can count down from 1 minute.
        v0.3 Add multiple choices 1/2/3/4 minutes in a dropdown menu.
        v0.9 add an indication of the end of the timer. (ex: sound,vibration, popup)
        
        v1.0 Add credit to the author of the book.
        v1.1 Add an affilate amazon purchase link to get the digital book.
        v2.0 Contact the author and propose a collaboration. Maybe include quotes from the book.
            perhaps make an audiobook of their book and translate it to english(it's in french for now.)
        +Todo: 
        -Create the visual in HTML; What buttons do i want? Prototyle, this can change later.
        -Add the JS to make it work.
        -Adjust the CSS Stylesheet. (on hover, Button colors, font, placement, etc.)
